    "first": "The lava starts flowing rapidly once the Lava Production Facility is operational. As you leave, the reindeer offers you a parachute, allowing you to quickly reach Gear Island.\n\nAs you descend, your bird's-eye view of Gear Island reveals why you had trouble finding anyone on your way up: half of Gear Island is empty, but the half below you is a giant factory city!\n\nYou land near the gradually-filling pool of lava at the base of your new *lavafall*. Lavaducts will eventually carry the lava throughout the city, but to make use of it immediately, Elves are loading it into large [crucibles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crucible) on wheels.\n\nThe crucibles are top-heavy and pushed by hand. Unfortunately, the crucibles become very difficult to steer at high speeds, and so it can be hard to go in a straight line for very long.\n\nTo get Desert Island the machine parts it needs as soon as possible, you'll need to find the best way to get the crucible *from the lava pool to the machine parts factory*. To do this, you need to minimize *heat loss* while choosing a route that doesn't require the crucible to go in a *straight line* for too long.\n\nFortunately, the Elves here have a map (your puzzle input) that uses traffic patterns, ambient temperature, and hundreds of other parameters to calculate exactly how much heat loss can be expected for a crucible entering any particular city block.\n\nFor example:\n\n```\n2413432311323\n3215453535623\n3255245654254\n3446585845452\n4546657867536\n1438598798454\n4457876987766\n3637877979653\n4654967986887\n4564679986453\n1224686865563\n2546548887735\n4322674655533\n\n```\n\nEach city block is marked by a single digit that represents the *amount of heat loss if the crucible enters that block*. The starting point, the lava pool, is the top-left city block; the destination, the machine parts factory, is the bottom-right city block. (Because you already start in the top-left block, you don't incur that block's heat loss unless you leave that block and then return to it.)\n\nBecause it is difficult to keep the top-heavy crucible going in a straight line for very long, it can move *at most three blocks* in a single direction before it must turn 90 degrees left or right. The crucible also can't reverse direction; after entering each city block, it may only turn left, continue straight, or turn right.\n\nOne way to *minimize heat loss* is this path:\n\n```\n2>>34^>>>1323\n32v>>>35v5623\n32552456v>>54\n3446585845v52\n4546657867v>6\n14385987984v4\n44578769877v6\n36378779796v>\n465496798688v\n456467998645v\n12246868655<v\n25465488877v5\n43226746555v>\n\n```\n\nThis path never moves more than three consecutive blocks in the same direction and incurs a heat loss of only `*102*`.\n\nDirecting the crucible from the lava pool to the machine parts factory, but not moving more than three consecutive blocks in the same direction, *what is the least heat loss it can incur?*\n\nTo begin, [get your puzzle input](17/input).\n\nAnswer:"
